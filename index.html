    <h1>Super Mario Odyssey</h1>
    <h2>My thoughts after playing for the first time</h2>
    <hr />
    <p>I try not to play too many video games nowadays, but I purchased my friend's old Nintendo Switch and have been playing more than I'd like to...</p>
    <p>The game I have been playing most recently has been Super Mario Odyssey, so I figured I would include some thoughts on the game.</p>

    <b>Things I like</b>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to explore</li>
            <li>The variety of playable characters</li>
            <li>I changed the hat to a visor</li>
        </ul>

    <b>Things I don't like</b>
        <ul>
            <li>It's pretty easy</li>
            <li>The levels can get repetitive</li>
        </ul>
